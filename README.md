# Scarf: Soil Carbon Sensing with Wi-Fi and Optical Signals
This repository contains the source code and data for the MobiCom'24 paper Scarf.

## Environment Requirements
- Matlab: we use MATLAB_R2022a. 
- A Linux machine with a GPU that is able to run ResNet is required. We use Linux 22.04 and CUDA version 12.3. We have tested NVIDIA GTX 1080, RTX 4070 and RTX 4090.
- Pytorch: we use torch version 2.0.1.
